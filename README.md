- add react component testing


## Install
For those of us with python3 as python:

npm install --python=/usr/bin/python2

## ImmutableJS
It doesn't currently play very nice with the way we would use it to have typings.
If anyone has a good solution to write reducers using immutablejs, let me know.
We could use it without any typing but then the reducers (and business logic) won't be
typed which is a pain.

## TOFIX
CTRL+C doesn't kill gulp entirely
